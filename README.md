# Computer-Science-32
Projects and Homeworks from David Smallberg's CS32 - Introduction to Computer Science II (Spring 2022) class

Note: Projects were tested in an environment where all the necessary libraries were appended to the submitted files.
Thus, some of the projects may not compile because these libraries were not included.
